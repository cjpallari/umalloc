# üß† Custom Memory Allocator (umalloc)

A lightweight custom implementation of `malloc()` and `free()` in C, designed to manage dynamic memory allocation manually. This project was built to deepen understanding of low-level memory management, pointer arithmetic, and system-level programming.

## üì¶ Features

- Implements basic `umalloc()` and `ufree()` functionality
- Manages a fixed-size memory buffer using headers and bookkeeping
- Supports best-fit allocation strategy (or customizable)
- Includes safety checks for memory corruption and invalid frees
- Minimal external dependencies ‚Äî pure C implementation
